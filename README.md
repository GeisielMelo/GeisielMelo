## Hello folks âŒ‘

I like making things, I'm a fairly curious person.

I'm a Mid-level Developer on the Marketing team at UniFTC. My focus is web development; we create and support various projects such as APIs, CMSs, integrations, blogs, websites, etc. Many of these projects are public, but most are internal.

I also enjoy developing my own projects like [github-profiles](https://profile-visualizer.vercel.app), [watchlist](https://watchlist.geisiel.com/), and [shiny](https://shinydex-pokedex.vercel.app/), where I have the opportunity to learn, apply my knowledge, and share my experiences with colleagues.

I used to work as a freelancer, developing e-commerce websites.

ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!
